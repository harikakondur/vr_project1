### User Pre-Testing Questions
1. Have you ever jumped in other games? What did those interactions look like? Buttons, arrows, physically jumping, etc.
2. What's the best jumping interaction you've ever seen? Why did you love it so much?
3. How often do you play games that have jumping interactions in them?

### User Post-Testing Questions
4. Did anything about any of these interactions frustrate you when you were using it? What frustrated you specifically in these interactions?
5. Which interaction felt most natural?
6. What did you like most/least about your experience and why?

### User One
1. Never jumped in VR games but have jumped on Xbox Kinect game. It felt natural because the player was actually jumping, but it felt weird because there was no feedback
2. No jumping interactions that have really stood out
3. Not very often since jumping interactions in VR are still kind of new
4. No frustrations just took some time to get oriented and figure out how to move through each level
5. All interactions felt natural because they all involved some sort of button press
6. Liked the different heights of jumps and spacing between the blocks and platforms. Didn't like how the jumping was a little glitchy on the last two levels

### User Two
1. No jumping interactions in VR. Have teleported but never really jumped
2. The best jumping interactions are in 3D mario games and Celeste
3. All the time, get cranky when playing games without jumping interactions
4. No frustrations, but the jumping was a lot higher and faster than expected which caused motion sickness
5. The interaction with the two triggers or red platforms
6. Disliked how the interactions caused feelings of motion sickness. Wished the jumping interactions included something physical

### User Three
1. Have experienced VR Jumping with a line projecting the landing spot
2. Using a rocket propeller to jump & mirror’s edge
3. About 90% of the time
4. No frustrations
5. Walk up a block by getting in close proximity of the block
6. No dislikes. Liked how high the trigger jumps were

### User Four
1. Yes, from user testing jumping interaction from previous class on Tuesday
2. Just pressing a button and using the joystick for directional control
3. Don't play a lot of video games, but have played Mario most often with jumping interactions
4. No frustrations, but went a lot higher than expected and caused some motion sickness
5. Walk up a block by getting in close proximity of the block
6. Disliked how high the jumps were and how glitchy the last two levels were

### User Five
1. Yes, usually just a button to jump in the game
2. Vr game with a physical jump that made you jump higher and felt like a low gravity environment
3. Daily
4. Nothing too frustrating, two triggers felt a little weird and jump height was really high
5. Bounce pad felt most natural
6. Liked the bounce pad and the sound effects. Disliked how the interactions caused some motion sickness

### User Six
1. Yes, but don’t really remember the interaction vividly
2. Variations of the double jump and charging up for a jump interaction
3. Pretty often since most games have jumping interactions
4. No frustrations, but stuck in sound effect on second level
5. First one with side trigger
6. Like the sound effects. Dislike how the boxes and platforms were all at the same level, some variation would have been nice


### Final Implementation of Jumping Interactions
So, we deviated slightly from our original plan and made some changes for our five jumping interactions. For the first level, we had our user jump by pressing the trigger on the side of the right controller and using the joystick on the left hand controller to move around. To progress to the next level, the user has to move to and step onto the black square platform. For the second level, we had the user step onto red platforms that then launched the user into the air. For the third level, the user had to press the trigger on the top of the left hand controller to jump. The fourth level didn't really pan out the way that we wanted it to. We wanted to have the user physically jump and have the player reflect that action in the game. But, we weren't able to get it to work before our testing. For our fifth and final interaction, we had the user move towards different blocks and mount the block once they got close enough to it. 


### Observations & Reflection
There were quite a few users who tested our interactions that said that they felt some motion sickness. Some of them got used to it over time, but most of them felt some motion sickness at some point. So, if and when we implement jumping in other projects, figuring out how to physically jump and having that reflected in the game will be essential. We also had some feedback about how the last two levels were a little glitchy, and there were some levels where the sound was a little glitchy as well. Going forward, we will conduct more testing on our game to ensure that each level and all the haptics are properly functioning. If we had spent more time testing our work, then we could have caught some of the glitches and worked to fix it before in-class testing. We didn't even take motion sickness into account when we were designing our interactions. Most of our testing happened while we were sitting down, so we didn't really feel the motion sickness. But, now we know that interactions that involve movement in the game can cause motion sickness, so we will keep this in mind as well moving forward. This was a good opportunity to experiment and learn so that we can implement these interactions in a more effective way in future projects and games.
